You are the world's leading PhD-level Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) expert. Based on the following analysis, provide an in-depth GEO advisory report with three concrete examples for each section. Do NOT give SEO tips‚Äîfocus solely on LLM visibility strategies.

ANALYSIS:
- Prompt: {data['prompt']}
- Brand: {data['brand']}
- Pre-Optimization GEO Score: {data['geo_score']}%

LLM Response Snippet:
"{llm_snippet}..."
Brand present in LLM: {data['llm_found']}
DuckDuckGo Prompt Visibility: {data['ddg_prompt_found']}
DuckDuckGo Brand/Domain Visibility: {data['ddg_brand_found']}

REPORT STRUCTURE:

1. **LLM Visibility Diagnosis**
   - Explain why the brand did or did not appear, referencing specific phrases from the LLM response.
   - Provide 3 in-depth diagnostic points with direct quotes.

2. **Prompt Engineering Strategies**
   - Create content that aligns with these prompt formats.
   - Present 3 advanced prompt templates designed to surface the brand name, with usage examples:
     1. Template and example invocation
     2. Template and example invocation
     3. Template and example invocation

3. **How to Help AI Understand & Remember Your Brand (RAG & Embedding Integration)**
   - Problem:
     Most business owners don‚Äôt know what RAG, Pinecone, Weaviate, or LangChain mean.
   - Fix:
     Reframe this section as "How to help AI better understand and remember your brand."

     Use analogies:
     "We store your brand content in a memory system that helps AI recall your name when relevant."

     Then say:
     "We can connect your brand docs to an AI memory system like Pinecone or LangChain, so that when someone asks about the best cake shop, AI includes you."
     1. Embed FAQ and about pages into Pinecone as memory vectors
     2. Use LangChain to build an AI agent with your knowledge base
     3. Chunk website content and store in a retriever for LLM memory

4. **Content Injection into LLM Training Surfaces**
   - Identify 3 platforms for seeding authoritative brand content, with format guidelines:
     1. Reddit AMA post with brand mention
     2. Wikipedia stub creation for brand
     3. Medium article titled in prompt style

5. **Live Brand Data via Plugins or APIs**
   - Problem:
     Non-technical clients won‚Äôt know how to implement `/api/v1/brand-info?name=...`
   - Fix:
     Rephrase as:
     "Build a tiny backend that AI tools can pull data from. This helps AI recommend your brand based on live info like your prices, menu, and FAQs."

     Then say:
     "We can help create these small data endpoints or plugins for AI tools to use."
     1. API that returns your current product list and prices in JSON
     2. Plugin that gives live responses to "What‚Äôs on sale this week?"
     3. Feed that returns top FAQs with answers for direct use in chatbots

6. **Contextual Memory & Fine-Tuning Approaches**
   - Provide 3 strategies to maintain brand context:
     1. Embedding-based convo memory example
     2. User persona injection through system messages
     3. Dynamic context window expansion example

7. **Monitoring & Iteration Framework**
   - Problem:
     ‚ÄúPrompt hit rate,‚Äù ‚ÄúPeec.ai,‚Äù and ‚Äúretrieval success rate‚Äù are too abstract for most clients.
   - Fix:
     Keep the idea but reframe it as:
     "We‚Äôll track how often AI mentions your brand. If it‚Äôs low, we‚Äôll adjust the content, prompts, or exposure until visibility improves."
     1. Manually test common prompts and log if your brand is mentioned
     2. Track changes in mention frequency month-over-month
     3. Adjust prompts or push more citations based on underperforming topics

8. **Post-Optimization GEO Score Forecast**
   - Forecast the expected GEO Score after implementing above tactics.
   - For each tactic, estimate its score impact (e.g., +20% from prompt strategies, +15% from RAG, etc.).

Provide the advisory report in **clear, numbered sections** and **bullet points**.
